# Learning Plan for Spring Boot and PostgreSQL

## Introduction

Welcome to the Learning Plan for Spring Boot and PostgreSQL! In this plan, we'll guide you through a 30-day journey to master these two powerful frameworks and databases.

Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step 30-day plan** to master **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**. This plan balances theory, hands-on practice, and project-based learning to ensure you gain both foundational knowledge and practical skills.

---

### **Week 1: Foundations**

**Goal**: Understand the basics of Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

**Day 1-2: Spring Boot Basics**

- Learn what Spring Boot is and its advantages.
- Set up your development environment:
  - Install Java (JDK 17+).
  - Install an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
  - Install Maven or Gradle for dependency management.
- Create your first Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
- Understand the project structure (e.g., `pom.xml`, `application.properties`, `main class`).

**Day 3-4: PostgreSQL Basics**

- Install PostgreSQL and set up a local database.
- Learn basic SQL commands:
  - `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
  - Understand primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
- Use a GUI tool like **pgAdmin** or **DBeaver** to interact with your database.

**Day 5-7: Connecting Spring Boot to PostgreSQL**

- Add PostgreSQL dependencies to your Spring Boot project (`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` and `postgresql`).
- Configure `application.properties` to connect to your PostgreSQL database.
- Create a simple `Entity` class and `Repository` interface using Spring Data JPA.
- Perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

### **Week 2: Intermediate Concepts**

**Goal**: Dive deeper into Spring Boot and PostgreSQL features.

**Day 8-10: Advanced Spring Boot Features**

- Learn about **Spring Boot Annotations**:
  - `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Autowired`.
- Understand **Dependency Injection** and how it works in Spring Boot.
- Explore **Spring Boot Actuator** for monitoring your application.

**Day 11-13: Advanced PostgreSQL**

- Learn about **transactions** and how to manage them in PostgreSQL.
- Understand **joins** (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) and write complex queries.
- Explore **indexing** and how it improves query performance.

**Day 14: Integration**

- Build a REST API with Spring Boot that interacts with PostgreSQL.
- Use **Postman** to test your API endpoints.
- Implement **pagination** and **sorting** in your API.

---

### **Week 3: Advanced Topics**

**Goal**: Master advanced concepts and best practices.

**Day 15-17: Spring Security**

- Add authentication and authorization to your Spring Boot application.
- Learn about **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure API access.
- Secure your REST API endpoints.

**Day 18-20: Performance Optimization**

- Optimize PostgreSQL queries using **EXPLAIN** and **ANALYZE**.
- Learn about **connection pooling** (e.g., HikariCP) in Spring Boot.
- Implement **caching** using Spring Bootâ€™s caching abstraction.

**Day 21-22: Testing**

- Write unit tests for your Spring Boot application using **JUnit** and **Mockito**.
- Test your PostgreSQL queries and database interactions.

---

### **Week 4: Project-Based Learning**

**Goal**: Build a real-world project to solidify your skills.

**Day 23-25: Project Planning**

- Choose a project idea (e.g., a **Task Management System**, **E-commerce API**, or **Blog Platform**).
- Define the requirements and design the database schema.
- Plan the API endpoints and application architecture.

**Day 26-28: Project Implementation**

- Build the backend using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
- Implement all CRUD operations, security, and advanced features.
- Test your application thoroughly.

**Day 29-30: Deployment and Documentation**

- Deploy your Spring Boot application to a cloud platform (e.g., **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Render**).
- Deploy your PostgreSQL database to a cloud service (e.g., **ElephantSQL** or **AWS RDS**).
- Document your project (e.g., README file, API documentation using **Swagger**).
